These are some vim plugins that are modified as my own purpose.


They are:

		+ Original version come from mark.vim version 1.1.10g of Yuheng Xie
  		+ What I changed: I changed color scheme for mark.
  * toggle_maximize.vim :
		+ Original come from toggle_maximize.vim version 1.28 of Joey Twiddle
  		+ What I changed: I changed bind key.

  * python.vim :
  		+ Original versione come from python.vim version 3.3.6 of Dmitry Vasiliev 
  No change, just move to github to used with vundle.
